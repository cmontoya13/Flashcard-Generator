PURPOSE:
This project uses NodeJS, JavaScript Objects and callback functions to create a flash card learning program of U.S. Presidents. Just use the following commands in a terminal to execute:
node BasicCard.js front
node BasicCard.js back
node ClozeCard.js text
node ClozeCard.js cloze

The JavaScript Object array of U.S. Presidents is accessed using NodeJS 'require' and 'export' statements.
